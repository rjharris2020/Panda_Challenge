# Panda_Challenge
What is the purpose of this challenge?
The purpose of this challenge is for me to use a dataset to showcase my skills using Python Pandas. In this challenge, I will use a dataset called purchase_data.csv from an independent gaming company. I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

I need to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
